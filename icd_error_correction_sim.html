  <h1>ICD Code Repair Simulator</h1>
  
  <div id="introduction">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      In our modern society, where every detail is meant to be recorded with precision, the fallibility of man continues to cast a long shadow. Within the sterile halls of hospitals, human error creeps into patient records, manifesting as slightly flawed ICD codes. These mistakes, though seemingly trivial, can distort the truth of a patient's condition and lead to consequences both unforeseen and dire.
    </p>
    <p>
      To counter this, our system steps in like an unyielding, mechanical sentinel. An artificial machine intelligence, cold and methodical, scrutinizes each record with a precision reminiscent of a calculating bureaucracy. It employs the tools of cosine similarity and classification—techniques as impersonal and relentless as those found in the algorithms of modern data science—to identify and validate every code.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, amid this rigorous, almost industrial quest for accuracy, there remains another voice—a moral, ethical counterweight. The Neuro Agent is this voice, a guardian of the principle that "patients over profits." It examines the corrected codes and, when a potential complication is revealed, it issues a somber warning: the error is not merely a technical oversight, but one that carries ethical weight. A short note is attached, a small testament to the fact that behind every statistic lies a human life.
    </p>
    <p>
      As you navigate this simulator, you will see a record’s original, flawed ICD code—accompanied by its description—laid bare. Through a step‐by‐step process, this error is exposed, scrutinized, and finally replaced with a corrected code. The column labeled "AMI Agent Fix" confirms the repair, while "Neuro Agent Note" may bear a brief yet potent reminder of the ethical stakes at hand. In this world, as in ours, truth must be pursued, even when it is obscured by human imperfection.

      <li><strong>Neuro Agent Note:</strong> A moral and ethical agent that evaluates the implications of switching codes, guided by the principle "patients over profits."
